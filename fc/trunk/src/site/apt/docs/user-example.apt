Quick Start - Deploying the Fosstrak ALE Middleware with an LLRP-Compliant RFID Reader


* {Objective}

	This tutorial will guide you through an example that shows how the Fosstrak ALE
	Middleware is configured to collect data from an LLRP-compliant RFID reader. 	
	
* {Prerequisites}

   You will need the following files:
   
   * a copy of the {{{http://maven-repository.fosstrak.org/releases/org/fosstrak/fc/fc-server/}fc-server-1.0.0.war or higher}}.  (<note:> LLRP support requires >= 1.0.0).
   
   * a copy of the {{{http://maven-repository.fosstrak.org/releases/org/fosstrak/fc/fc-webclient/}fc-webclient fc-webclient-0.4.0.war or higher}}
   
   * a copy of the {{{http://maven-repository.fosstrak.org/releases/org/fosstrak/reader/reader-rp-client}reader protocol client version 0.3.1 or higher}} (any other HTTP monitor that displays incoming HTTP request will work, too). 
   
   * a copy of this LLRP {{{../files/ROSPEC_example.llrp} ADD_ROSPEC message}}
   
   * a copy of this ALE  {{{../files/ECSpec_current.xml}ECSpec message}} 
   
   * a copy of this ALE {{{../files/LLRPReader.xml} logical reader definition file}} 
   
   []
   
   You will also need to install the following programs if they are not already present on your machine:
   
   * {{{../../llrp/index.html}Fosstrak LLRP Commander}}  
   
   * {{{https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=170933&package_id=195190}Rifidi Reader Emulator}}
   
   * {{{http://tomcat.apache.org/} Apache Tomcat Java Servlet Container}}
   
     
* Prepare {Tomcat}

   Install {{{http://tomcat.apache.org/} Apache Tomcat}} if you have not installed it yet. 
   
   Copy the two WAR files (fc-server-<VERSION>.war and fc-webclient-<VERSION>.war) into the Tomcat's <webapps> directory and start Tomcat.
   Tomcat will automatically deploy the two WAR files for you.

   
* Setup LLRP reader emulator 

   To simplify this demo, we use a reader emulator to generate tag reads. 
   
   * Install the  {{{https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=170933&package_id=195190}Rifidi emulator}} (if needed) 
   
   * Start the Rifidi emulator
   
   * Instantiate a new reader of type "LLRPReader" that listens on port 5084 (default) using the Reader Wizard
   
   * Start the reader just instantiated
   
   We will return to the LLRP reader emulator once the other components are configured. 
   
* Setup GUI for incoming HTTP ALE notifications 
   
   To display the reports with the aggregated data sent by the filtering and collection server, we will start a Fosstrak tool that displays incoming HTTP requests. 
   Make sure the provided port is not used by some other application.

+--------------+
java -cp <READER_RP_CLIENT_VERSION>.jar \ 
	org.fosstrak.reader.rp.client.EventSinkUI <PORT>

example:
java -cp reader-rp-client-0.3.1.jar \ 
	org.fosstrak.reader.rp.client.EventSinkUI 9999
+--------------+

	The screen will remain empty until the configuration of the filtering
	and collection server is complete. 


* {Configure} the Fosstrak ALE web-client

  In this example, we will use the web-based client to configure the
  filtering and collection server. Before we can use the web-based
  client, we need to tell it the URL through which the filtering and
  collection server can be accessed.  

  Start your web browser and point it to the address of the web-based
  client.
  
+--------------+
http://<SERVER>:<PORT>/<WEBCLIENT_VERSION>/services/ALEWebClient.jsp

example:
http://localhost:8080/fc-webclient-0.4.0/services/ALEWebClient.jsp
+--------------+

  In the next step, specify two endpoints that tell the web-based client 
  where the "Filtering and Collection API" and the "Logical Reader API"
  can be found.
  
  Set the endpoint to the filtering and collection server by selecting
  the "setEndpoint(String endPointName)" method in the "Filtering and Collection API". 
  Click "Invoke" to execute the command.
  
+--------------+
endpoint: http://<SERVER>:<PORT>/<FCSERVER_VERSION>/services/ALEService

example: 
http://localhost:8080/fc-server-1.0.0/services/ALEService
+--------------+

  Verify that a connection between the web-based client and the server
  can be established by clicking "getVendorVersion()". A version
  number should be returned.
  
  Set the endpoint to the filtering and collection server's Logical Reader
  API by selecting "setEndPoint(String endPointName)" in the "LogicalReader API".
  Click "Invoke" to execute the command.
  
+--------------+
endpoint: http://<SERVER>:<PORT>/<FCSERVER_VERSION>/services/ALELRService

example: 
http://localhost:8080/fc-server-1.0.0/services/ALELRService
+--------------+

  Verify that a connection between the web-based client and the server
  can be established by clicking "getVendorVersion()". A version
  number should be returned.    
  
  
* {Set} the readers connected to ALE Middleware via the ALE Logical Reader API 
  
  The next step is to configure the fc-server with the LLRP reader connected. 
  Click on "define(String readerName, LRSpec spec)" in the section LogicalReader API. 
  
  DO NOT CONFUSE the define method for an EventCycle with the define method for a logical reader! 
  For this tutorial name your reader "LogicalReader1" and use the {{{../files/LLRPReader.xml} LLRPReader.xml}} as your LRSpec.
  
+--------------+
readerName:  <READERNAME>
specFilePath: <PATH_TO_SPEC>\<SPEC_NAME>.xml

example:
readerName: LogicalReader1
specFilePath: c:\epc\LLRPReader.xml
+--------------+

  Verify that the reader has been created by clicking on "getLogicalReaderNames()". 
  The call should return a list of logical readers in brackets. 
  Make sure that the reader just creates is listed.  
  
  In the Rifidi emulator you can now see the message exchange with the Fosstrak ALE middleware.
  
  You can inspect the logical reader specification LRSpec by the method "getLRSpec(String readerName)".
  
  
  
* {Define} the Filtering and Collection Behavior via the ALE Filtering and Collection API
  
  In the next step you will define an ALE ECSpec. This tells the ALE Middleware how the RFID tag reads
  ariving from the Rifidi Emulator should be filtered and aggregated.   
  
  Invoke the method  "define(String specName, String specFilePath)". 
  DO NOT CONFUSE the define method for an EventCycle with the define method for a logical reader! 
  For this tutorial name your EventCycle "specCURRENT" and load this {{{../files/ECSpec_current.xml}ECSpec message}} 

+--------------+
specName: <SPEC_NAME>
specFilePath: <PATH_TO_SPEC>\<SPEC_NAME>.xml

example:
specName: specCURRENT
specFilePath: c:\epc\ECSpec_current.xml
+--------------+
  
  Verify the correct defintion of your ECSpec by invoking the method "getECSpecNames()". 
  You should get a list of ECSpec names currently defined in brackets. 
  Make sure that the ECSpec you just defined is listed.   
  
* {Specify} the Event Consumer of the ALE Events Being Sent

  When there is no subscriber for an ECSpec, the ECSpec is not executed. We therefore need to specify a 
  listener by subscribing our event sink to the ECSpec "specCURRENT" we added earlier.
  
  Invoke "subscribe(String specName, String notificationUri)" and register the URL on which the event sink GUI is listening.
  
+--------------+
notificationURI: http://<SERVER>:<PORT>
specName: <SPEC_NAME>

example:
notificationURI: http://localhost:9999
specName: specCURRENT
+--------------+

	The ALE will start sending empty ECReports to the event sink GUI as the 
	Rifidi emulator is not configured to send EPC tag reads via the LLRP protocol yet.
	

* {Configure} the Rifidi Emulator to Report Tags in "Range"

	Start the LLRP Commander (via Eclipse) and connect to the remote adapter instance running on the ALE. 
	Check, if you can send and retrieve messages from the reader by sending a GET_READER_CAPABILITIES message.
	
	Create a new LLRP message and replace the content by the content from the LLRP 
	{{{../files/ROSPEC_example.llrp}RO_SPEC}}. Send the message to the Rifid Emulator.
	From the context menu (right-click on the Rifidi Emulator), select "Send ENABLE_RO_SPEC message"
	to instruct the reader to enable the ROspec just loaded.
	
	Now the virtual reader is ready to deliver tags to the ALE. 
	
	Switch to the Rifidi reader emulator and create a tag (SGTIN96, GEN2). 
	When you place the tag on the reader antenna, the tag reads will be reported to 
	the Fosstrak ALE Middleware. After the tag reads are filtered and collected as specified
	in the ECSpec, they are delivered by the Fosstrak ALE middleware to the event sink GUI.
