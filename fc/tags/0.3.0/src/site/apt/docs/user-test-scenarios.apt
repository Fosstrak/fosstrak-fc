* {About} these Tests

  These tests should help you test your Accada Filtering & Collection 
  environment. The tests are wide spread, to cover most of the functionallity
  of the Filtering and Collection middleware.

  To define a subscriber to subscribe to an ECSpec, a very simple way is to 
  start and register an {{{..//docs/user-example.html#Subscribe} Eventsink}}.

~~ * {Filtering} Tests
~~
~~ The ECFilterSpec implements a flexible filtering scheme based on two pattern lists.
~~ Each list contains zero or more EPC patterns. Each EPC pattern denotes a single EPC, a
~~ range of EPCs, or some other set of EPCs. An EPC is included in the final report if (a) the EPC does not match any
~~ pattern in the excludePatterns list, and (b) the EPC does match at least one pattern
~~ in the includePatterns list. The (b) test is omitted if the includePatterns list
~~ is empty.
